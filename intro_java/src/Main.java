//Declaring Variables
// Type, Name, =, value, ;
//int myFirstNumber = 5;

//Primitive Types
//byte byteValue = 10;
//short shortValue = 20;
//int intValue = 50;
//long longTotal = 50000L + 10L * (byteValue + shortValue + intValue);

//Floats and Doubles Primitives
// It's more common to use a double rather than float in Java. Doubles take offer more precision and are faster!

//Char and Boolean
//Char can only store a single character in '' (Useful when trying to get the last key pressed by a gamer!)

//String concatenation
//If used with int's then it adds for +. But if used with strings, it concatenates!
// Immutable means you can't change it after it's been created.
// Operator's: +, -, *, /, etc. Operands are objects being manipulated by an operator.

// Incrementation
// result = result + 1;
// result++;
// result+=1; //You're able to change the increment with this one to the int of your choice unlike the others.

// Decrementation
// result = result - 1;
// result--;
// result-=1; //You're able to change the increment with this one to the int of your choice unlike the others.
